# Ao3Reader
As a case study and POC this App was developed as a reader app for the AO3 plataform, it works alongside the AO3Api for data processing. As in, it was developed to only work with the API by the same author.

This App was developed as a Xamarin.Forms application.

The objective was to simply get data from the API and show in a simple and user experience friendly way for mobile applications.

As it is, it's ONLY a reader app, not having any functionality for downloading, commenting, kudoing works, or any other functionality the plataform has.

Development was dropped since the events that ocurred regarding AO3 reader apps.

## Important
As means of clarity either as legal or non-legal information (if this does apply).

No harm and/or copyright infringment was intended considering the recent events regarding the AO3 plataform, this is simply a POC and object of study for this functionality.

This project is not hosted in any plataform and there are no plans to do it, by the original author.

Any and all hosted systems derived from this project have no relation whatsoever and the original author claim no right to it.

It's also recommended to desist to do so, and if one chooses to go on with this intention, the original author demands to not be linked or having any right whatsoever. Any action taken from any party using this project as base is totally theirs.

As the plataform is open-source and non-profit this project is also.
